            <p class="resource-description"><strong>Description:</strong> Extreme heat waves in South Sudan, exacerbated by climate change, have compelled the closure of schools in the nation. Forecasted temperatures exceeding 113 degrees Fahrenheit, unusual for the dry season, prompted authorities to shut down schools for at least two weeks. The lack of infrastructure, such as air-conditioning, exacerbates the challenge for schools, particularly outside the capital, Juba. This closure not only disrupts the academic calendar but also exacerbates existing challenges in a country already grappling with conflict, displacement, and food insecurity. </p>

            <p class="resource-description"><strong>Description:</strong> In response to an impending extreme heat wave, South Sudan's government has taken proactive measures, closing all schools for two weeks to protect children from soaring temperatures reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit). Health and education ministries urged parents to keep children indoors during this period. The decision aims to safeguard against health risks associated with the heat. Peter Garang, a resident of Juba, supports the move, suggesting schools be equipped with electricity for air conditioning. South Sudan faces numerous challenges, including climate vulnerability exacerbated by civil conflict, droughts, and floods, underscoring the importance of proactive measures for public safety and well-being.</p>

            <p class="resource-description"><strong>Description:</strong> ADespite government warnings and school closures due to an ongoing heatwave in South Sudan, many professionals continue their outdoor work. Authorities have issued advisories as temperatures reach record highs of 41-45Â°C, urging people to avoid outdoor activities and watch for heatstroke. Despite the risks, workers like Sworo Ben, a boda boda operator, and traffic police officers persevere in their duties, though facing challenges like dehydration and reduced business. While some, like beverage wholesaler Emmanuel Dumo, suffer losses due to perishable goods, others, like ice cream seller Chol Chol Bol, find opportunities for profit amidst the heatwave.</p>
